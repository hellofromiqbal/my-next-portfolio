      <p className='text-tertiary'>In 2020, I worked as a <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>customer service</span> in a private banking company in Indonesia. Worked using various non-integrated web applications for customer data requiring me to perform the same tasks in different applications. This experience sparked my <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>curiosity</span> about programming and <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>web development</span>.</p>
      <p className='text-tertiary'>I began to <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>learn</span> web programming in my free time, alongside my daytime job and realized it was <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>complex</span> but this <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>challenge</span> only fueled my <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>excitement</span> for the field. A year later, I resigned to <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>fully dedicate</span> myself on web programming, finding <span className='text-secondary font-medium'>joy</span> in coding and continually expanding my knowledge. Off the computer, I enjoy video games, time with friends, and playing futsal.</p>
